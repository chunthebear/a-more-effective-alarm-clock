# A More Effective Alarm Clock
(as part of the Hackathon event at Uvic in 2018)

The default alarm clock on my phone does not work for me! 

Current problems:
1. Snooze button is the worst.
2. Drowsiness and no motivation after hearing the alarm.

Features of that I want to include:
1. Getting rid of that sonnze button.
2. 5 sec countdown after cancelling the alarm to better motivate myself.
3. Alarm starts with something gentle first.
4. The interface should be based on the colour blue to increase the amount of blue light,
   and the brightness should be maximum (in the morning, not during setting up the alarm).
