# A More Effective Alarm Clock
(as part of the Hackathon event at Uvic in 2018)

The default alarm clock on my phone does not work for me! 

Current problems:
1. Snooze button is the worst.
2. Drowsiness and no motivation after hearing the alarm.

Features of that I want to include:
1. Getting rid of that snooze button (easiest thing to do ever.. just do not include it!).
2. Alarm starts with something gentle first, and includes a voice stating the current time. 
   It also voices out my to-do list afterwards.
3. 5 sec countdown after cancelling the alarm to better motivate myself.
4. The interface should be based on the colour blue to increase the amount of blue light,
   and the brightness should be maximum (in the morning, not during setting up the alarm).
5. Another good design is to include a feature to help myself better fall asleep:
   before sleeping, colour of the clock becomes warm automatically, 
   and white noise is being played for 30 mins.
